  Review                   = {Programming Embedded Systems Second Edition Programming Embedded Systems, Second Edition with C and GNU Development Tools Foreword If you mention the word embedded to most people, they'll assume you're talking about reporters in a war zone. Few dictionaries—including the canonical Oxford English Dictionary—link embedded to computer systems. Yet embedded systems underlie nearly all of the electronic devices used today, from cell phones to garage door openers to medical instruments. By now, it's nearly impossible to build anything electronic without adding at least a small microprocessor and associated software. Vendors produce some nine billion microprocessors every year. Perhaps 100 or 150 million of those go into PCs. That's only about one percent of the units shipped. The other 99 percent go into embedded systems; clearly, this stealth business represents the very fabric of our highly technological society. And use of these technologies will only increase. Solutions to looming environmental problems will surely rest on the smarter use of resources enabled by embedded systems. One only has to look at the network of 32-bit processors in Toyota's hybrid Prius to get a glimpse of the future. Page 1

  Review                   = {AN1278 APPLICATION NOTE LIN (LOCAL INTERCONNECT NETWORK) SOLUTIONS by Microcontroller Division Applications INTRODUCTION Many mechanical components in the automotive sector have been replaced or are now being replaced by intelligent mechatronical systems. A lot of wires are needed to connect these components. To reduce the amount of wires and to handle communications between these systems, many car manufacturers have created different bus systems that are incompatible with each other. In order to have a standard sub-bus, car manufacturers in Europe have formed a consortium to define a new communications standard for the automotive sector. The new bus, called LIN bus, was invented to be used in simple switching applications like car seats, door locks, sun roofs, rain sensors, mirrors and so on. The LIN bus is a sub-bus system based on a serial communications protocol. The bus is a single master / multiple slave bus that uses a single wire to transmit data. To reduce costs, components can be driven without crystal or ceramic resonators. Time syn- chronization permits the correct transmission and reception of data. The system is based on a UART / SCI hardware interface that is common to most microcontrollers. The bus detects defective nodes in the network. Data checksum and parity check guarantee safety and error detection. As a long-standing partner to the automotive industry, STMicroelectronics offers a complete range of LIN silicon products: slave and master LIN microcontrollers covering the protocol handler part and LIN transceivers for the physical line interface. For a quick start with LIN, STMicroelectronics supports you with LIN software enabling you to rapidly set up your first LIN communication and focus on your specific application requirements.
