abstract = {INTRODUCTION In order to draw users' attention and to increase their satisfaction towards online information search results, search engine developers and vendors try to predict user preference based on the user behavior. Recommendations are provided by the search engines or online vendors to the users. Recommendation systems are implemented in commercial and non-profit web sites to predict the user preferences. For commercial web sites, accurate predictions may result in higher selling rates. The main functions of recommendation systems include analyzing user data and extracting useful information for further predictions. Recommendation systems are designed to allow users to locate the preferable items quickly and to avoid the possible information overloads. Recommendation systems apply data mining techniques to determine the similarity among thousands or even millions of data. Collaborative filtering techniques have been successful in enabling the prediction of user preferences in the recommendation systems (Hill et al., 1995, Shardanand {\&} Maes, 1995). There are three major processes in the recommendation systems: object data collections and representations, similarity decisions, and recommendation computations. Collaborative filtering aims at finding the relationships among the new individual and the existing data in order to further determine the similarity and provide recommendations. How to define the similarity is an important issue. How similar should two objects be in order to finalize the preference prediction? Similarity decisions are concluded differently by collaborative filtering techniques. For example, people that like and dislike movies in the same categories would be considered as the ones with similar behavior (Chee et al., 2001). The concept of the nearest-neighbor algorithm has been included in the implementation of the recommendation systems (Resnick et al., 1994). The designs of pioneer recommendation systems focus on entertainment fields (Resnick et al., 1994, Hill et al., 1995, Shardanand {\&} Maes, 1995, Dahlen et al., 1998). The challenge of conventional collaborative filtering algorithms is the scalability issue (Sarwar et al., 2000a). Conventional algorithms explore the relationships among system users in large datasets. User data are dynamic, which means the data vary within a short time period. Current users may change their behavior patterns, and new users may enter the system at any moment. Millions of user data, which are called neighbors, are to be examined in real time in order to provide recommendations (Herlocker et al., 1999). Searching among millions of neighbors is a time-consuming process. To solve this, item-based collaborative filtering algorithms are proposed to enable reductions of computations because properties of items are relatively static (Sarwar et al., 2001). Suggest is a Top-N recommendation engine implemented with item-based recommendation algorithms (Karypis. 2000, Deshpande {\&} Karypis, 2004). Meanwhile, the amount of items is usually less than the number of users. In early 2004, Amzn Investor Relations (2004) states that Amazon.com Apparel {\&} Accessories Store provides about one hundred and fifty thousands of items but has more than one million customer accounts that have ordered from this store. Amazon.com employs item-based algorithm for collaborative-filtering-based recommendations (Linden et al., 2003) to avoid the disadvantages of conventional collaborative filtering algorithms.},

abstract = {Supply chain pressures have caused some firms to reexamine their processes. In doing so, firms are exploring emerging technology such as RFID to enable seamless exchange of information within their supply chain. While RFID promised to "revolutionize" the way business processes are managed today, the impact and benefits of the technology are still unclear and ambiguous concepts such as "intelligent products", "smart supply chains" or "the internet of things" are still creating confusion within potential adopters. In this paper an attempt is made to (i) clarify the ambiguity surrounding RFID vs. other AIDC and IOS technologies such as the EPC Network (ii) specify the technology readiness {\&} IT related requirements of actual and emerging applications, and (iii) propose a framework to highlight how the technology can be used to support RFID/EPC enabled ecommerce processes and support practitioners and academicians in assessing the impact of RFID on electronic supply chain business processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

abstract = {Published research on smart homes and their users is growing exponentially, yet a clear understanding of who these users are and how they might use smart home technologies is missing from a field being overwhelmingly pushed by technology developers. Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Abstract Although Internet of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment.

abstract = {Abstract Although Internet of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.

The primary use of these containers was to store fresh products, such as sauces or fruits, in industrial kitchens at restaurants and hotels. Due to the addition of the RFID tags in these contain? ers, more accurate and historic information about product and usage can be gathered. Hence, this new information RF? ID-based system helps to achieve better inventory control, improve events management such as cold-storage room rep? lenishment, or reduce products close to expiration date. The importance of this project is in the fact that, according to a previous review, there is no an initiative similar to develop this RFID application anywhere else. The project was an in? itiative of the plastic in-moulding factory ARA VEN with the collaboration of LOO.ID Lab (Identification Laboratory for the supply chain) at Zaragoza Logistics Center.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this domain, there is the need of tools supporting the design and analysis of applications. In this paper, the Smart Environment Metamodel (SEM) framework is proposed. The framework allows to model applications by exploiting concepts specific to the smart environment domain. SEM approaches the modeling from two different points of view, namely the functional and data perspectives. The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments. The effectiveness of the framework is shown by applying it to the modeling of a real smart office scenario that has been developed, deployed and analyzed.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) paradigm poses new challenges to the communication technology as numerous heterogeneous objects will need to be connected. To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.},

This paper gives an overview about the state of the art in the area of DSM. Subsequently, it is shown what is needed to convert a standard, commercial-off-the-shelf refrigerator into a networked smart fridge. Following this, a simulation model and a basic algorithm for load control of a refrigerator is presented and analyzed. Finally, possible improvements of hardware and the algorithms are proposed.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this domain, there is the need of tools supporting the design and analysis of applications. In this paper, the Smart Environment Metamodel (SEM) framework is proposed. The framework allows to model applications by exploiting concepts specific to the smart environment domain. SEM approaches the modeling from two different points of view, namely the functional and data perspectives. The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments. The effectiveness of the framework is shown by applying it to the modeling of a real smart office scenario that has been developed, deployed and analyzed.},

Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. TS  - RIS},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) paradigm poses new challenges to the communication technology as numerous heterogeneous objects will need to be connected. To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a review of the state of the art of smart homes. We will first look at the research work related to smart homes from various view points; first in the view point of specific techniques such as smart homes that utilize computer vision based techniques, smart homes that utilize audio-based techniques and then smart homes that utilize multimodal techniques. Then we look at it from the view point of specific applications of smart homes such as eldercare and childcare applications, energy efficiency applications and finally in the research directions of multimedia retrieval for ubiquitous environments. We will summarize the smart homes based research into these two categories. In the survey we found out that some well-known smart home applications like video based security applications has seen the maturity in terms of new research directions while some topics like smart homes for energy efficiency and video summarization are gaining momentum. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.},

Though, a lot of innovations have taken place in this field, there are no good mechanisms for describing and modelling smart environments in a formal manner. $\pi$-calculus, proposed by Milner is a formal language which provides strong mathematical base that can be used for modelling and verifying system requirements. In this paper, we intend to offer a contribution towards understanding the usefulness of $\pi$-calculus as a language for programming a special kind of ubiquitous application: smart environments. Here we propose a model that includes a type checker for $\pi$-calculus and an application that executes $\pi$-calculus statements and generates the graphical representation of the smart environment represented by the $\pi$-calculus statement.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},
