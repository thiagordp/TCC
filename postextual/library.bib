@book{Fortino2014,
abstract = {In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining more and more attention both in the academic and in the industrial worlds. IoT is a concept describing a vision in which everyday objects will be connected to the Internet, will be identified, and will, possibly, communicate with other devices. These objects are typically referred as “smart objects”, which can be defined as real artifacts augmented with computing, communication, sensing/actuation and storing functionalities. Their importance resides in the capabilities they have to make physical environments “smart” so as to provide novel cyberphysical services to people. In the last years, several middlewares for SOs were proposed. Middlewares, widely used in conventional distributed systems, are fundamental tools for the design and implementation of smart objects as well as of smart environment applications. They provide general and specific abstractions (e.g. object computation model, inter-object communication, sensory/actuation interfaces, discovery service, knowledge management) through which smart objects and their related applications can be easily built up. In this chapter, we present an overview of middlewares for smart objects and smart environments and compare them according to the most important general and specific requirements that have been identified in the literature so far. Moreover, such middlewares are also compared according to a feature-oriented framework to better highlight their distinctive properties. The comparison therefore provides a clear picture about the suitability of such middlewares to support the development of SO-based IoT systems. Finally, the chapter will briefly discuss on-going challenges in this research area.},

@article{Sandholm2014,
abstract = {We present a testbed for exploring novel smart refrigerator interactions, and identify three key adoption-limiting interaction shortcomings of state-of-the-art smart fridges: lack of 1) user experience focus, 2) low-intrusion object recognition and 2) automatic item position detection. Our testbed system addresses these limitations by a combination of sensors, software filters, architectural components and a RESTful API to track interaction events in real-time, and retrieve current state and historical data to learn patterns and recommend user actions. We evaluate the accuracy and overhead of our system in a realistic interaction flow. The accuracy was measured to 83-88{\%} and the overhead compared to a representative state-of-the-art barcode scanner improved by 27{\%}. We also showcase two applications built on top of our testbed, one for finding expired items and ingredients of dishes; and one to monitor your health. The pattern that these applications have in common is that they cast the interaction as an item-recommendation problem triggered when the user takes something out. Our testbed could help reveal further user-experience centric interaction patterns and new classes of applications for smart fridges that inherently, by relying on our testbed primitives, mitigate the issues with existing approaches.},

abstract = {In the realm of Internet of Things (IoT), the complexity of designing ubiquitous and smart systems with dynamically evolving structure has grown to an extent where system modelling and verification has become a real hurdle. Though, a lot of innovations have taken place in this field, there are no good mechanisms for describing and modelling smart environments in a formal manner. $\pi$-calculus, proposed by Milner is a formal language which provides strong mathematical base that can be used for modelling and verifying system requirements. In this paper, we intend to offer a contribution towards understanding the usefulness of $\pi$-calculus as a language for programming a special kind of ubiquitous application: smart environments. Here we propose a model that includes a type checker for $\pi$-calculus and an application that executes $\pi$-calculus statements and generates the graphical representation of the smart environment represented by the $\pi$-calculus statement.},

Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.},

To many, the massive data generated or captured by IoT are considered having highly useful and valuable information. Data mining will no doubt play a critical role in making this kind of system smart enough to provide more convenient services and environments. This paper begins with a discussion of the IoT. Then, a brief review of the features of "data from IoT" and "data mining for IoT' is given. Finally, changes, potentials, open issues, and future trends of this field are addressed.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

The primary use of these containers was to store fresh products, such as sauces or fruits, in industrial kitchens at restaurants and hotels. Due to the addition of the RFID tags in these contain? ers, more accurate and historic information about product and usage can be gathered. Hence, this new information RF? ID-based system helps to achieve better inventory control, improve events management such as cold-storage room rep? lenishment, or reduce products close to expiration date. The importance of this project is in the fact that, according to a previous review, there is no an initiative similar to develop this RFID application anywhere else. The project was an in? itiative of the plastic in-moulding factory ARA VEN with the collaboration of LOO.ID Lab (Identification Laboratory for the supply chain) at Zaragoza Logistics Center.},

abstract = {—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorpo- rate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Fur- thermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.

In this domain, there is the need of tools supporting the design and analysis of applications. In this paper, the Smart Environment Metamodel (SEM) framework is proposed. The framework allows to model applications by exploiting concepts specific to the smart environment domain. SEM approaches the modeling from two different points of view, namely the functional and data perspectives. The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments. The effectiveness of the framework is shown by applying it to the modeling of a real smart office scenario that has been developed, deployed and analyzed.},

abstract = {Recommendation Systems have become an important research area in mobile computing. Although various recommendation systems have been developed to help users to deal with information overload, few systems focus on proactive information recommendation. This paper presents a news recommender system that proactively pushes just-in-time personalized news articles to mobile users based on user's contextual information as well as news content. User's information needs are estimated based on Bayesian network technique. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Model, which supports both Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering, is developed to rate the relevance of news articles. The weight of contexts (criteria) is automatically adjusted via individual-based and/or group-based (group decision making) assignment. The experiments show that the system can push relevant news to mobile users.},

Especially the past year has seen a tremendous surge of interest in the Internet of Things. Consortia have been formed to define frameworks and standards for the IoT. Companies have started to introduce numerous IoT- based products and services. And a number of IoT-related acquisitions have been making the headlines, including, e.g., the prominent takeover of Nest by Google for {\$}3.2 billion and the subsequent acquisitions of Dropcam by Nest and of SmartThings by Samsung.

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements plays a fundamental role. Such requirements include data confidentiality and authentication, access control within the IoT network, privacy and trust among users and things, and the enforcement of security and privacy policies. Traditional security countermeasures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the different standards and communication stacks involved. Moreover, the high number of interconnected devices arises scalability issues; therefore a flexible infrastructure is needed able to deal with security threats in such a dynamic environment. In this survey we present the main research challenges and the existing solutions in the field of IoT security, identifying open issues, and suggesting some hints for future research.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We study the proximity effects of metallic environments on the performance of high frequency (HF) radio frequency identification (RFID) reader antenna operating at 13.56 MHz. The performance of a typical HF RFID reader loop antenna in the proximity of various metal plate configurations is experimentally investigated in terms of resonant frequency, field intensity, and field distribution. The study shows that the presence of the metal plates shifts up the resonant frequency of the antenna and weakens its field intensity. The proximity effects are strongly dependent on the size of the metal plate, distance between the plate and the antenna as well as the orientation of the plate. Such effects greatly degrade the reading range and restrict the co-existence of HF RFID systems. A solution to alleviate the effects is to re-tune or co-design the reader antenna in proximity with the metallic objects based on the information from the study. As an example, a loop antenna is co-designed with a metal plate to configure a metal-backed loop antenna, and optimized for an RFID smart shelf system to restrain the interference and enhance the detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Published research on smart homes and their users is growing exponentially, yet a clear understanding of who these users are and how they might use smart home technologies is missing from a field being overwhelmingly pushed by technology developers. Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) paradigm poses new challenges to the communication technology as numerous heterogeneous objects will need to be connected. To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things. This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for Internet of things. In addition, the paper presents a general background on cognitive radio and Internet of Things with some potential applications. Our survey is different from existing surveys in that we focus on recent advances and ongoing research directions in cognitive radio in the context of Machine to Machine and Internet of Things. We review CR solutions that address generic problems of IoT including emerging challenges of autonomicity, scalability, energy efficiency, heterogeneity in terms of user equipment capabilities, complexity and environments, etc. The solutions are supported by our taxonomy of different CR approaches that are classified into two categories, flexible and efficient networking, and tackling heterogeneity. This paper intends to help new researchers entering the domain of CR and IoT by providing a comprehensive survey on recent advances.},

abstract = {Smart embedded objects will become an important part of what is called the Internet of Things. However, the integration of embedded devices into the Internet introduces several challenges, since many of the existing Internet technologies and protocols were not designed for this class of devices. In the past few years, there have been many efforts to enable the extension of Internet technologies to constrained devices. Initially, this resulted in proprietary protocols and architectures. Later, the integration of constrained devices into the Internet was embraced by IETF, moving towards standardized IP-based protocols. In this paper, we will briefly review the history of integrating constrained devices into the Internet, followed by an extensive overview of IETF standardization work in the 6LoWPAN, ROLL and CoRE working groups. This is complemented with a broad overview of related research results that illustrate how this work can be extended or used to tackle other problems and with a discussion on open issues and challenges. As such the aim of this paper is twofold: apart from giving readers solid insights in IETF standardization work on the Internet of Things, it also aims to encourage readers to further explore the world of Internet-connected objects, pointing to future research opportunities.},

Since the tide of automation flowed over the industry, manufacturing business, even the living space of mankind resulting from shifting and highly developing of computer technique such as office-automation (OA), home-automation (HA), and Manufacture-automation (MA) etc. Though automation spread throughout the manufacturing in last decade, there seemed no such equal attention with home appliance. In this paper, the automation developed into the place where we spend most of our time becomes a brand-new thinking. There are so many home appliances in our living space, and how to make them intelligent so as to let our life more safety, convenient, and comfortable will be a challenge to our knowledge. In this study, some technique and skills especially related 3C (computer, communication, content) were developed to make our home appliances intelligent such as radio remote control, sensors invented by researchers, auto-dialing system, and image analysis with CCD (charged-coupled device) image-fetched. Through linking the sub-systems' function, the main function of the home appliance worked smartly - in this case, we use a refrigerator as the center of all home appliances in a family, the refrigerator could sense the lack of the food, drinks, even irregular shape fruits through all designed sensors and CCD images analysis system, and it also could auto-dial the vendors to deliver the thing those were sensed insufficient. In addition to detect capability, the refrigerator could assign works to other appliance through inter-net or wireless radio remote control system, for example, supposing that we forgot to turn off the gas oven after we had reached far away our home, we could dial cell phone or phone into the refrigerator to generate command code to turn off the fire through remote control module set up both on refrigerator and oven.

abstract = {Introduced in iOS 7, iBeacon is an exciting technology enabling new location awareness possibilities for apps. Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a device with iBeacon technology can be used to establish a region around an object. This allows an iOS device to determine when it has entered or left the region, along with an estimation of proximity to a beacon . There are both hardware and software components to consider when using iBeacon technology, and this document will give an introduction to both, along with suggested uses and best practices to help ensure a highly effective deployment leading to an outstanding user experience. ! iBeacon has 3 different audiences. You may fall into one, two, or possibly all three of these categories, depending on your role. ! 1. App Developers If you want to add new location awareness to your application, you would use the Core Location APIs in iOS to be notified when the iOS device has moved into or out of a beacon region. You can also determine approximate proximities to a device generating iBeacon advertisements. Everything you need to get started is included in the iOS SDK, no additional license is required. 2. People Deploying Devices With iBeacon Technology Whether you manage a sports arena, a museum, a retail store, or any of the myriad other physical locations where beacons could be employed, you need to be aware of how these devices work, issues surrounding signal strength and materials, and understand how to calibrate and test your deployment. If you are interested in using the iBeacon Logo on signage at a venue, but will not make devices with iBeacon technology, you will need to obtain an iBeacon logo license before using the iBeacon logo. Please visit https:// developer.apple.com/ibeacon/ to apply for a license to use the iBeacon logo.},

@article{Lee2009,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION In order to draw users' attention and to increase their satisfaction towards online information search results, search engine developers and vendors try to predict user preference based on the user behavior. Recommendations are provided by the search engines or online vendors to the users. Recommendation systems are implemented in commercial and non-profit web sites to predict the user preferences. For commercial web sites, accurate predictions may result in higher selling rates. The main functions of recommendation systems include analyzing user data and extracting useful information for further predictions. Recommendation systems are designed to allow users to locate the preferable items quickly and to avoid the possible information overloads. Recommendation systems apply data mining techniques to determine the similarity among thousands or even millions of data. Collaborative filtering techniques have been successful in enabling the prediction of user preferences in the recommendation systems (Hill et al., 1995, Shardanand {\&} Maes, 1995). There are three major processes in the recommendation systems: object data collections and representations, similarity decisions, and recommendation computations. Collaborative filtering aims at finding the relationships among the new individual and the existing data in order to further determine the similarity and provide recommendations. How to define the similarity is an important issue. How similar should two objects be in order to finalize the preference prediction? Similarity decisions are concluded differently by collaborative filtering techniques. For example, people that like and dislike movies in the same categories would be considered as the ones with similar behavior (Chee et al., 2001). The concept of the nearest-neighbor algorithm has been included in the implementation of the recommendation systems (Resnick et al., 1994). The designs of pioneer recommendation systems focus on entertainment fields (Resnick et al., 1994, Hill et al., 1995, Shardanand {\&} Maes, 1995, Dahlen et al., 1998). The challenge of conventional collaborative filtering algorithms is the scalability issue (Sarwar et al., 2000a). Conventional algorithms explore the relationships among system users in large datasets. User data are dynamic, which means the data vary within a short time period. Current users may change their behavior patterns, and new users may enter the system at any moment. Millions of user data, which are called neighbors, are to be examined in real time in order to provide recommendations (Herlocker et al., 1999). Searching among millions of neighbors is a time-consuming process. To solve this, item-based collaborative filtering algorithms are proposed to enable reductions of computations because properties of items are relatively static (Sarwar et al., 2001). Suggest is a Top-N recommendation engine implemented with item-based recommendation algorithms (Karypis. 2000, Deshpande {\&} Karypis, 2004). Meanwhile, the amount of items is usually less than the number of users. In early 2004, Amzn Investor Relations (2004) states that Amazon.com Apparel {\&} Accessories Store provides about one hundred and fifty thousands of items but has more than one million customer accounts that have ordered from this store. Amazon.com employs item-based algorithm for collaborative-filtering-based recommendations (Linden et al., 2003) to avoid the disadvantages of conventional collaborative filtering algorithms.},

abstract = {The electricity industry is now at the verge of a new era-an era that promises, through the evolution of the existing electrical grids to smart grids, more efficient and effective power management, better reliability, reduced production costs, and more environmentally friendly energy generation. Numerous initiatives across the globe, led by both industry and academia, reflect the mounting interest around not only the enormous benefits but also the great risks introduced by this evolution. This paper focuses on issues related to the security of the smart grid and the smart home, which we present as an integral part of the smart grid. Based on several scenarios, we aim to present some of the most representative threats to the smart home/smart grid environment. The threats detected are categorized according to specific security goals set for the smart home/smart grid environment, and their impact on the overall system security is evaluated. A review of contemporary literature is then conducted with the aim of presenting promising security countermeasures with respect to the identified specific security goals for each presented scenario. An effort to shed light on open issues and future research directions concludes this paper.},

abstract = {Supply chain pressures have caused some firms to reexamine their processes. In doing so, firms are exploring emerging technology such as RFID to enable seamless exchange of information within their supply chain. While RFID promised to "revolutionize" the way business processes are managed today, the impact and benefits of the technology are still unclear and ambiguous concepts such as "intelligent products", "smart supply chains" or "the internet of things" are still creating confusion within potential adopters. In this paper an attempt is made to (i) clarify the ambiguity surrounding RFID vs. other AIDC and IOS technologies such as the EPC Network (ii) specify the technology readiness {\&} IT related requirements of actual and emerging applications, and (iii) propose a framework to highlight how the technology can be used to support RFID/EPC enabled ecommerce processes and support practitioners and academicians in assessing the impact of RFID on electronic supply chain business processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) predicts user preferences in item selection based on the known user ratings of items. As one of the most common approach to recommender systems, CF has been proved to be effective for solving the information overload problem. CF can be divided into two main branches: memory-based and model-based. Most of the present researches improve the accuracy of Memory-based algorithms only by improving the similarity measures. But few researches focused on the prediction score models which we believe are more important than the similarity measures. The most well-known algorithm to model-based is the matrix factorization. Compared to the memory-based algorithms, matrix factorization algorithm generally has higher accuracy. However, the matrix factorization may fall into local optimum in the learning process which leads to inadequate learning. CF approaches are usually designed to provide products to potential customers. Therefore the accuracy of the methods is crucial. In this paper, we propose various solutions to make a quality recommendation. First, we proposed a new prediction score model for the Memory-based method. Second, we proposed a differential model that considers the adjustment process after the training process in the existing matrix factorization methods. Third, a novel hybrid collaborative filtering is outlined to avoid or compensate for the shortcomings of matrix factorization and neighbor-based methods. In the end, we performed the experiments on Movie Lens datasets and the results confirmed the effectiveness of our methods.},

@article{Yan2014,
abstract = {Abstract  Internet of Things (IoT) is going to create a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into information networks in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings. Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. TS  - RIS},
