Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.},

Then we look at it from the view point of specific applications of smart homes such as eldercare and childcare applications, energy efficiency applications and finally in the research directions of multimedia retrieval for ubiquitous environments. We will summarize the smart homes based research into these two categories. In the survey we found out that some well-known smart home applications like video based security applications has seen the maturity in terms of new research directions while some topics like smart homes for energy efficiency and video summarization are gaining momentum. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although various recommendation systems have been developed to help users to deal with information overload, few systems focus on proactive information recommendation. This paper presents a news recommender system that proactively pushes just-in-time personalized news articles to mobile users based on user's contextual information as well as news content. User's information needs are estimated based on Bayesian network technique. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Model, which supports both Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering, is developed to rate the relevance of news articles. The weight of contexts (criteria) is automatically adjusted via individual-based and/or group-based (group decision making) assignment. The experiments show that the system can push relevant news to mobile users.},

abstract = {We study the proximity effects of metallic environments on the performance of high frequency (HF) radio frequency identification (RFID) reader antenna operating at 13.56 MHz. The performance of a typical HF RFID reader loop antenna in the proximity of various metal plate configurations is experimentally investigated in terms of resonant frequency, field intensity, and field distribution. The study shows that the presence of the metal plates shifts up the resonant frequency of the antenna and weakens its field intensity. The proximity effects are strongly dependent on the size of the metal plate, distance between the plate and the antenna as well as the orientation of the plate. Such effects greatly degrade the reading range and restrict the co-existence of HF RFID systems. A solution to alleviate the effects is to re-tune or co-design the reader antenna in proximity with the metallic objects based on the information from the study. As an example, a loop antenna is co-designed with a metal plate to configure a metal-backed loop antenna, and optimized for an RFID smart shelf system to restrain the interference and enhance the detection accuracy.},

This allows an iOS device to determine when it has entered or left the region, along with an estimation of proximity to a beacon . There are both hardware and software components to consider when using iBeacon technology, and this document will give an introduction to both, along with suggested uses and best practices to help ensure a highly effective deployment leading to an outstanding user experience. ! iBeacon has 3 different audiences. You may fall into one, two, or possibly all three of these categories, depending on your role. ! 1. App Developers If you want to add new location awareness to your application, you would use the Core Location APIs in iOS to be notified when the iOS device has moved into or out of a beacon region. You can also determine approximate proximities to a device generating iBeacon advertisements. Everything you need to get started is included in the iOS SDK, no additional license is required. 2. People Deploying Devices With iBeacon Technology Whether you manage a sports arena, a museum, a retail store, or any of the myriad other physical locations where beacons could be employed, you need to be aware of how these devices work, issues surrounding signal strength and materials, and understand how to calibrate and test your deployment. If you are interested in using the iBeacon Logo on signage at a venue, but will not make devices with iBeacon technology, you will need to obtain an iBeacon logo license before using the iBeacon logo. Please visit https:// developer.apple.com/ibeacon/ to apply for a license to use the iBeacon logo.},

  abstract  = {This paper offers an HCI perspective on the emergent agenda of the Internet of Things (IoT). The purpose is to provide insights and resources for how HCI could engage productively with the IoT agenda while it is still evolving and being realised. We examined and reviewed HCI- related literature and commercial products of the IoT, categorising a final collection of 89 research papers and 93 commercial products into two tables. Through this, we are able to provide a snapshot of the types, extent and foci of both research and commercial efforts. It has also revealed trends, opportunities, as well as gaps for how HCI could proceed when engaging more deeply with the IoT. Finally, this review provides insights for HCI, suggesting tools, methods and potential approaches that can help ensure a human-centred IoT.},

  abstract  = {Published research on smart homes and their users is growing exponentially, yet a clear understanding of who these users are and how they might use smart home technologies is missing from a field being overwhelmingly pushed by technology developers. Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},
