We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.},

User's information needs are estimated based on Bayesian network technique. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Model, which supports both Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering, is developed to rate the relevance of news articles. The weight of contexts (criteria) is automatically adjusted via individual-based and/or group-based (group decision making) assignment.

	abstract = {We study the proximity effects of metallic environments on the performance of high frequency (HF) radio frequency identification (RFID) reader antenna operating at 13.56 MHz. The performance of a typical HF RFID reader loop antenna in the proximity of various metal plate configurations is experimentally investigated in terms of resonant frequency, field intensity, and field distribution. The study shows that the presence of the metal plates shifts up the resonant frequency of the antenna and weakens its field intensity. The proximity effects are strongly dependent on the size of the metal plate, distance between the plate and the antenna as well as the orientation of the plate. Such effects greatly degrade the reading range and restrict the co-existence of HF RFID systems. A solution to alleviate the effects is to re-tune or co-design the reader antenna in proximity with the metallic objects based on the information from the study. As an example, a loop antenna is co-designed with a metal plate to configure a metal-backed loop antenna, and optimized for an RFID smart shelf system to restrain the interference and enhance the detection accuracy.},

There are both hardware and software components to consider when using iBeacon technology, and this document will give an introduction to both, along with suggested uses and best practices to help ensure a highly effective deployment leading to an outstanding user experience. ! iBeacon has 3 different audiences. You may fall into one, two, or possibly all three of these categories, depending on your role. ! 1. App Developers If you want to add new location awareness to your application, you would use the Core Location APIs in iOS to be notified when the iOS device has moved into or out of a beacon region. You can also determine approximate proximities to a device generating iBeacon advertisements. Everything you need to get started is included in the iOS SDK, no additional license is required. 2. People Deploying Devices With iBeacon Technology Whether you manage a sports arena, a museum, a retail store, or any of the myriad other physical locations where beacons could be employed, you need to be aware of how these devices work, issues surrounding signal strength and materials, and understand how to calibrate and test your deployment. If you are interested in using the iBeacon Logo on signage at a venue, but will not make devices with iBeacon technology, you will need to obtain an iBeacon logo license before using the iBeacon logo.

We examined and reviewed HCI- related literature and commercial products of the IoT, categorising a final collection of 89 research papers and 93 commercial products into two tables. Through this, we are able to provide a snapshot of the types, extent and foci of both research and commercial efforts. It has also revealed trends, opportunities, as well as gaps for how HCI could proceed when engaging more deeply with the IoT. Finally, this review provides insights for HCI, suggesting tools, methods and potential approaches that can help ensure a human-centred IoT.},

Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

While the Internet of Things is still seeking its own shape, its effects have already stared in making incredible strides as a universal solution media for the connected scenario. Architecture specific study does always pave the conformation of related field. The lack of overall architectural knowledge is presently resisting the researchers to get through the scope of Internet of Things centric approaches. This literature surveys Internet of Things oriented architectures that are capable enough to improve the understanding of related tool, technology, and methodology to facilitate developer’s requirements. Directly or indirectly, the presented architectures propose to solve real-life problems by building and deployment of powerful Internet of Things notions. Further, research challenges have been investigated to incorporate the lacuna inside the current trends of architectures to motivate the academics and industries get involved into seeking the possible way outs to apt the exact power of Internet of Things. A main contribution of this survey paper is that it summarizes the current state-of-the-art of Internet of Things architectures in various domains systematically. },

The goal of the proposed framework is to illustrate both the common features of the various CBR-RSs as well as the points were these systems take different solutions. The proposed framework was derived by the analysis of some systems and techniques comprising nine different recommendation functionalities. The ultimate goal of the this framework is to ease the evaluation and the comparison of case-based reasoning recommender systems and to provide a tool to identify open areas for further research.},

Methods for generating context-aware recommendations were classified into the pre-filtering, post-filtering and contextual modeling approaches. This paper focuses on comparing the pre-filtering, the post-filtering, the contextual modeling and the un-contextual approaches and on identifying which method dominates the others and under which circumstances. Although some of these methods have been studied independently, no prior research compared the relative performance to determine which of them is better. This paper proposes an effective method of comparing the three methods to incorporate context and selecting the best alternatives. As a result, it provides analysts with a practical suggestion on how to pick a good approach in an effective manner to improve the performance of a context-aware recommender system.},

Recommender System (RS) overcomes the problem of information overload and suggests items that interest to a user. It has gained a lot of popularity in past decades and huge amount of work has been done in this field. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular and widely used approach for RS which tries to analyze the user's interest over the target item on the basis of views expressed by other like-minded users. This paper gives a brief idea of various approaches used for Recommender System and provides an insight of Collaborative Filtering technique. Here, we also discuss well-known methods for CF i.e. Memory-based, Model-based, and hybrid approaches and at last we focus on research challenges that need to be addressed.},

  abstract  = {A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.},

Therefore, literature was reviewed systematically from ACM, IEEE, Springer and Science Direct databases. 1006 studies were found, eight of which met the eligibility criteria. From the chosen studies, only one was not applied to the areas of nutrition and physical activity. The recommender techniques adopted were Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering. The main mobile device identified was the Smartphone and the Operating System was Android. After analyzing the results, it was possible to realize that, although they are widely used in e­commerce, recommendation systems do not have many mobile healthcare applications, and the existing ones are recent.},

  abstract  = {The ever-more complex labor world and the current economic crisis ask learners and workers to continuously update their qualification levels to stay relevant on the job. Hence, education and training providers need to adjust their offerings to cope with such evolving requirements. However, the huge number of variables to consider means that finding the right learning content that lets an individual fill his or her competency gap might be difficult. The authors' semantic-based recommender system crosses heterogeneous information about learners' and workers' backgrounds as well as advertised job positions with a catalog of online courses to identify the most appropriate learning resources. Experimental observations showed a good agreement between human and automatic recommendations, confirming the applicability of the emerging semantic technology to the generation of user-centered services that can adapt to individuals' learning needs. The authors discuss the details of their system in a video Web extra at http://youtu.be/A8c5MwnlGvA. A second Web extra shows the training booklet for evaluating the authors' system and the results of the automatic recommendation; it's available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/ieeecs.cdn.csdl.public/mags/it/2015/05/mit2015050050s.pdf.},

Recommendation systems for software engineering (RSSEs) are potentially useful in supporting the extraction, maintenance, and categorization of feature models. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of an RSSE to automatically recommend features for software product lines, the types of these features, and how they could be related to each other. Such a recommender should save time and tedium over doing the work manually. We present FFRE, a prototype recommendation tool for the extraction of features and their relationships from software requirements specification (SRS) documents. FFRE is based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and heuristics. FFRE is evaluated qualitatively from four SRS documents and compared against other tools and approaches.},

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},
